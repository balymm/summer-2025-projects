# summer-2025-projects
This repo is where I’m tracking everything I’ll be learning and doing during summer 2025 — math, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python, and more. I’ll be posting updates, wins, fails, and general progress day by day. Just trying to stay consistent and see how much I can grow over the summer.
