I finished SQLBolt tutorials today. Since I already had experience with SQL before, it was not that hard. But amazing excersizes, understood outer joins perfectly.
It is different feeling and motivation when you are doing it not because of some exams, but because you want to learn. I will do excel next, because as well as I know powerBI needs excel
